## Check Your Understanding

1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 

**Explanation:** You want to test your code often throughout your development process. If you wait until the end to run all the tests, it will be much harder to find and fix any bugs that come up. It is best to run your tests via a GitHub action rather than manually before pushing code because you might forget to run the tests manually before pushing. Having the tests in a GitHub action helps to prevent code that does not meet the requirements from accidentally being pushed to the repo.
